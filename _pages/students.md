### Ph.D., Ben McCamish
###### (co-advise with Arash Termehchy)
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/ben.jpeg" alt="Ben McCamish" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> Ben McCamish is a graduate student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science's Ph.D. program at Oregon State University. He received his B.S. in Computer Science from Washington State University Vancouver in 2013. His current research projects involve the analysis of databases produced by PMUs. Mr. McCamish's research interests lie in the area of Large Database Management, Database Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and the Smart Grid.

### Ph.D., Brandon Johnson
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/brandon.jpeg" alt="Brandon Johnson" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> [Brandon Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnbran/) is a fourth year Ph.D. candidate at OSU in the School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. He received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at OSU in 2013 and continued on his education path with a focus on energy systems. Brandon's focus has been on renewable energy integration through reliability based methods and, more recently, a focus on distribution system disaster mitigation through advanced control schemes. Since his graduate studies began, he has participated in the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center helping to forward the industry of wave energy. In 2016, Brandon was awarded a NSF Fellowship by participating in a program that focuses on the process of transdisciplinary research in Risk and Uncertainty Quantification in Marine Science. Brandon's research interests span a large group but mostly focus on renewable energy, smart grids, grid reliability and resiliency, grid modeling (transmission and distribution), and energy policy and economics.

### Ph.D., Adam Mate
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/adam.jpeg" alt="Adam Mate" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> [Adam Mate](https://linkedin.com/in/adammate) is an Electrical Engineer - specialized in Power System Engineering - and a fourth year PhD Candidate working with Dr. Cotilla-Sanchez. He graduated with an MSc degree at Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BUTE) in Budapest, Hungary, and currently is pursuing his Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD degree at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. Adam's ongoing research focuses on power system restoration and resiliency (development of a restoration scheme for the PNW, and timeline reduction of restoration algorithms;  increasing the disaster preparedness of Oregon’s power grid; impact of Geomagnetic Disturbances on power systems), and renewable energy (application of renewable resources in power system restoration; modeling wind and wave farms - analyzing their effect on the power grid’s reliability) related questions. His research expertise and interest further includes: modeling and operation of power systems, integration of renewable resources, energy and environmental legislation issues, and smart and micro grids.

### Ph.D., Phylicia Cicilio
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/phylicia.jpeg" alt="Phylicia Cicilio" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> Phylicia Cicilio is pursuing her Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with the Energy Systems Research Group. She received her B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the University of New Hampshire, and her M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oregon State University. Phylicia's research focuses on power systems dynamic load modeling, microgrid control, and renewable energy and energy storage integration. Phylicia is also a co-founder of the Graduate Student Committee of the OSU Chapter of Society of Women Engineers and heads the mentoring program for the group. In her spare time, Phylicia enjoys rock climbing, hiking, and playing the bari sax.

### Undergraduate Researcher, Marissa Kwon

<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/marissa.jpeg" alt="Marissa Kwon" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> [Marissa Kwon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissa-kwon-7a5731131) is a rising junior at Oregon State University expecting to graduate in 2020 with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. Her interests lie in engineering applications to conservation, and hopes to increase the breadth of her undergrad experience by working with Power Systems. On her free time, Marissa enjoys cooking and outdoor activities. She spent this past summer hiking the ridges of West Oahu (HI) and improving the remote real-time agricultural sensors for the USGS to support native plant restoration in her home state.
