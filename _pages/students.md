### Ph.D., Travis Hagan
Travis Hagan graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2015. Travis is currently entering his 3rd year of his Ph.D. program with Oregon State. His primary research interest is real-time adaptive power system protection. This includes, but is not limited to, real-time power system monitoring, adaptive protection schemes, and algorithms for determining protection settings. After graduating, Travis hopes to find a career with a National Lab or a large system operator to deploy real-time protection systems.

### Ph.D., David Glennon
###### (co-advise with Ted Brekken)
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/david.jpeg" alt="David Glennon" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> David Glennon is Ph.D. candidate in the Power and Energy Systems group at OSU’s school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Northern Arizona University in 2013, and immediately began work in the semiconductor industry, working as a IC Product Engineer for a large implantable medical device company. Through work, he developed data management, visualization and statistical analysis skills alongside applying his academic training in electronics. After 4 years in industry, he returned to pursue a higher degree in power systems and renewable energy in order to shift career focus, graduating with an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Oregon State University. His ongoing research focuses on the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster elements of the power grid into voltage control areas in a way that is useful for the planning and operations of the power system. His research interests include anything that allows for the combination of big data analysis and power engineering or renewable energy applications, as well as anything applying machine learning techniques.
