Welcome to the ECS Lab website. I lead a group of student researchers with the vision of making electricity infrastructure sustainable for the planet and safe for all humans.

I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu) at the [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu) [College of Engineering](http://engineering.oregonstate.edu). I am part of the Energy Systems research group, housed at the Wallace Energy Systems and Renewables Facility, and mainly work in the following power system areas:

 * Cascading outages in power grids
 * Power system protection, resilience, and cybersecurity
 * Smart grids and microgrids
 * Wide-area power system data

Currently serving as President for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, [Oregon Chapter](http://shpeoregon.org), and Secretary of the [IEEE Working Group on Cascading Failures](http://sites.ieee.org/pes-cascading/).
