### Ph.D., Ben McCamish
###### (co-advise with Arash Termehchy)
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/ben.jpeg" alt="Ben McCamish" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> Ben McCamish is a graduate student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science's Ph.D. program at Oregon State University. He received his B.S. in Computer Science from Washington State University Vancouver in 2013. His current research projects involve the analysis of databases produced by PMUs. Mr. McCamish's research interests lie in the area of Large Database Management, Database Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and the Smart Grid.

### Ph.D., Brandon Johnson
<img src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/brandon.jpeg" alt="Marissa Kwon" width="150" height="200" style="float:left" style="padding-right:15px"> [Brandon Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnbran/) is a fourth year Ph.D. candidate at OSU in the School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. He received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at OSU in 2013 and continued on his education path with a focus on energy systems. Brandon's focus has been on renewable energy integration through reliability based methods and, more recently, a focus on distribution system disaster mitigation through advanced control schemes. Since his graduate studies began, he has participated in the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center helping to forward the industry of wave energy. In 2016, Brandon was awarded a NSF Fellowship by participating in a program that focuses on the process of transdisciplinary research in Risk and Uncertainty Quantification in Marine Science. Brandon's research interests span a large group but mostly focus on renewable energy, smart grids, grid reliability and resiliency, grid modeling (transmission and distribution), and energy policy and economics.

### Ph.D., Adam Mate
<img src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/adam.jpeg" alt="Marissa Kwon" width="150" height="200" style="float:left" style="padding-right:15px"> [Adam Mate](https://linkedin.com/in/adammate) is a third year Ph.D. candidate in OSU's Energy Systems Research Group working with Dr. Cotilla-Sanchez. He received BS and MS degrees in Electrical Engineering - focusing on Electric Power Systems - at Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary, and is currently working toward his Electrical and Computer Engineering Ph.D. degree at Oregon State University. Adam's ongoing research is focused on resiliency related questions (increasing the resiliency and disaster preparedness of Oregon's and the Pacific Northwest's power system) and on renewable energies (modeling wind and wave farms, simulating and analyzing their effect on the electrical grid and its reliability). His research expertise and interest further includes: modeling and operation of power systems, integration of renewable energy sources, smart and micro grids, and energy and environmental legislation.

### Ph.D., Phylicia Cicilio
<img src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/phylicia.jpeg" alt="Marissa Kwon" width="150" height="200" style="float:left" style="padding-right:15px"> Phylicia Cicilio is pursuing her Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with the Energy Systems Group. She received her B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the University of New Hampshire in 2013. She now works with Dr. Cotilla-Sanchez focusing on smart grid and energy storage modeling. In her spare time, Phylicia enjoys rock climbing, hiking, and playing the bari sax.

### Undergraduate Researcher, Marissa Kwon

<img src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/marissa.jpeg" alt="Marissa Kwon" width="150" height="200" style="float:left" style="padding-right:15px"> <p style="overflow:hidden" [Marissa Kwon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissa-kwon-7a5731131) is a rising junior at Oregon State University expecting to graduate in 2020 with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. Her interests lie in engineering applications to conservation, and hopes to increase the breadth of her undergrad experience by working with Power Systems. On her free time, Marissa enjoys cooking and outdoor activities. She spent this past summer hiking the ridges of West Oahu (HI) and improving the remote real-time agricultural sensors for the USGS to support native plant restoration in her home state. style </p>
