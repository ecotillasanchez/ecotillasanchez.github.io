She received her B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the University of New Hampshire, and her M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oregon State University. Phylicia's research focuses on power systems dynamic load modeling, microgrid control, and renewable energy and energy storage integration. Phylicia is also a co-founder of the Graduate Student Committee of the OSU Chapter of Society of Women Engineers and heads the mentoring program for the group. In her spare time, Phylicia enjoys rock climbing, hiking, and playing the bari sax.

### Ph.D., Travis Hagan
Travis Hagan graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2015. Travis is currently entering his 3rd year of his Ph.D. program with Oregon State. His primary research interest is real-time adaptive power system protection. This includes, but is not limited to, real-time power system monitoring, adaptive protection schemes, and algorithms for determining protection settings. After graduating, Travis hopes to find a career with a National Lab or a large system operator to deploy real-time protection systems.

### M.S., Michael Boller

He received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from George Fox University. Michael’s research focuses on clustering of buses in the power grid with a focus on adequacy of reactive reserve resources.

### M.S., David Glennon
###### (co-advise with Ted Brekken)
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/david.jpeg" alt="David Glennon" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> David Glennon is a 2nd year M.S. candidate in the Power and Energy Systems group at OSU’s school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Northern Arizona University in 2013, and immediately began work in the semiconductor industry, working as a IC Product Engineer for a large implantable medical device company. Through work, he developed data management, visualization and statistical analysis skills alongside applying his academic training in electronics. After 4 years in industry, he returned to pursue a higher degree in power systems and renewable energy in order to shift career focus. His ongoing research focuses on the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster elements of the power grid into voltage control areas in a way that is useful for the planning and operations of the power system. His research interests include anything that allows for the combination of big data analysis and power engineering or renewable energy applications, as well as anything applying machine learning techniques.

### M.S., Austin Lassetter
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/austin.jpeg" alt="Austin Lassetter" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> Austin Lassetter is a senior, expecting to graduate in 2019 with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and in 2020 with a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering. His interests lie in machine learning, signal processing, and power systems. Specifically, he is interested in improving upon or introducing machine learning algorithms to Smart Grid applications, to system losses of the grid and better integrate energy storage control. In his spare time, Austin enjoys running, biking, board games, video games, hiking, and watching sports.

### Undergraduate Researcher, Yenifer Ramirez
