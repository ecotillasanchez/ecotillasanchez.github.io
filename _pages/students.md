She received her B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the University of New Hampshire, and her M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oregon State University. Phylicia's research focuses on power systems dynamic load modeling, microgrid control, and renewable energy and energy storage integration. Phylicia is also a co-founder of the Graduate Student Committee of the OSU Chapter of Society of Women Engineers and heads the mentoring program for the group. In her spare time, Phylicia enjoys rock climbing, hiking, and playing the bari sax.

### Ph.D., Travis Hagan

### M.S., Chris Dizon
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/chris.jpeg" alt="Chris Dizon" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> Greetings, Chris Dizon here! After receiving my BS in Electrical Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder the Summer of 2017, I moved to Oregon to begin my Master of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at OSU that fall term. In the last two years of my undergraduate career, a group and I worked on developing/monitoring photovoltaic energy as the fuel source for primitive communication systems in Papua New Guinea. During this time, the growing importance and relevance of renewable energies grew on me, developing into the subject of my research interests and encouraging me to seek higher education at a graduate school. This eventually aligned me with the research work of the OSU Energy Systems group. Growing up in Maryland then being land-locked in Colorado, I returned to the coast where the prevalence of wave energy conversion became the base of the thesis subject I want to pursue. In my free time I attempt to make noise on a guitar, draw some "art," fall off my bike in the mountains, and make an effort to partake in all/any outdoor related activities with some friends :].

### M.S., Michael Boller
###### (co-advise with Ted Brekken)
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/michael.jpeg" alt="Michael Boller" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> Michael Boller is pursuing his Ph.D./M.S. in the OSU School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from George Fox University. Michael’s research focuses on clustering of buses in the power grid with a focus on adequacy of reactive reserve resources.

### M.S., David Glennon
###### (co-advise with Ted Brekken)
<img align="left" src="https://ecotillasanchez.github.io/files/david.jpeg" alt="David Glennon" width="150" height="200" style="padding-right:15px"> David Glennon is a 2nd year M.S. candidate in the Power and Energy Systems group at OSU’s school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Northern Arizona University in 2013, and immediately began work in the semiconductor industry, working as a IC Product Engineer for a large implantable medical device company. Through work, he developed data management, visualization and statistical analysis skills alongside applying his academic training in electronics. After 4 years in industry, he returned to pursue a higher degree in power systems and renewable energy in order to shift career focus. His ongoing research focuses on the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster elements of the power grid into voltage control areas in a way that is useful for the planning and operations of the power system. His research interests include anything that allows for the combination of big data analysis and power engineering or renewable energy applications, as well as anything applying machine learning techniques.
