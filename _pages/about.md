Welcome to the ECS Lab website. I lead a group of student researchers with the vision of making electricity infrastructure sustainable for the planet and safe for all humans.

I am an Associate Professor and Associate School Head in the [School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu) at the [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu) [College of Engineering](http://engineering.oregonstate.edu). I am part of the Energy Systems research group, housed at the Wallace Energy Systems and Renewables Facility, and mainly work in the following areas:

 * Cascading outages in power grids
 * Power system protection, resilience, and cybersecurity
 * Smart grids and microgrids
 * Wide-area power system data
 * Energy access and inclusion

Currently serving as Vice-Chair of the [IEEE Working Group on Cascading Failures](http://sites.ieee.org/pes-cascading/).

**Land acknowledgment**: Oregon State University in Corvallis, OR, is located within the traditional homelands of the Mary's River or Ampinefu Band of Kalapuya. Following the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 (Kalapuya etc. Treaty), Kalapuya people were forcibly removed to reservations in Western Oregon. Today, living descendants of these people are a part of the [Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon](https://www.grandronde.org) and the [Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians](https://ctsi.nsn.us).
