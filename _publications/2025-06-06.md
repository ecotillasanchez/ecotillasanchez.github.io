WEC-Grid is an open-source Python framework for integrating wave energy converter (WEC) models into power system simulations. It bridges WEC-Sim with established electrical simulators (PSS®E, PyPSA) through a unified API, a standardized data model, and an SQLite-backed store. The framework provides modular case handling, WEC-to-grid coupling, and a quasi steady-state simulation loop that harmonizes results across modelers. Core functionalities include reproducible data persistence, cross-modeler comparison, and visualization tools for buses, generators, and WEC farms. By lowering the barrier to marine energy integration studies, WEC-Grid supports academic research, teaching, and preliminary industry assessments of grid stability and renewable penetration. Documentation, Jupyter notebooks, and an executable capsule accompany the release, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility. Together, these features position WEC-Grid as a flexible platform for exploring the interactions of emerging WEC technologies with existing and future power systems.
